Learning covariance and contravariance in TypeScript could be tricky (I know from my experience!), but knowing them is a great addition to understanding types and subtyping.  

In this post, you'll read an accessible explanation of covariance and contravariance concepts.  

```toc

```

## 1. Subtyping

Thanks to inheritance, in TypeScript a *base* type can be extended by another type named *subtype*. 

For example, let's define a base class `User`, then extend that class by an `Admin` class:

```twoslash include user
class User {
  userName: string;

  constructor(userName: string) {
    this.userName = userName;
  }
}
```

```twoslash include admin
class Admin extends User {
  isSuperAdmin: boolean;

  constructor(userName: string, isSuperAdmin: boolean) {
    super(userName);
    this.isSuperAdmin = isSuperAdmin;
  }
}
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: user

// @include: admin
```

Since `Admin` extends `User` (`Admin extends User`), you could say that `Admin` is a *subtype* of base class `User`.  

Subtyping is possible not only in classes but also in other types. For example, the literal string type `'Hello'` is a subtype of `string`, or the literal number type `42` is a subtype of `number`.  

Now let's introduce the symbol `A <: B` &mdash; meaning *"A is a subtype of B"*. Because `Admin` is a subtype of `User`, now you could write shorter:

```
Admin <: User
```

Additionally, I'm going to use a helper type `IsSubtype<S, P>`, which evaluates to `true` if `S` if a subtype of `P`, and `false` otherwise:

```twoslash include is-subtype
type IsSubtype<S, P> = S extends P ? true : false;
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: user
// @include: admin
// ---cut---
// @include: is-subtype
```

Since `Admin` is a subtype of `User`, as expected, `IsSubtype<Admin, User>` is `true`:

```ts twoslash
// @include: user
// @include: admin
// @include: is-subtype
// ---cut---
type T1 = IsSubtype<Admin, User>;
//   ^?
```

## 2. Covariance

Let's think about some asynchronous code that fetches `User` and `Admin` instances. Thus, you have to work with promises of `User` and `Admin`.  

Having `Admin <: User`, does it mean that `Promise<Admin> <: Promise<User>` holds as well? In other words, is `Promise<Admin>` a subtype of `Promise<User>`?

Let's see what TypeScript is saying:

```ts twoslash{5}
// @include: user
// @include: admin
// @include: is-subtype
// ---cut---
type T21 = IsSubtype<Promise<Admin>, Promise<User>>
//   ^?
```

TypeScript has showed that indeed `Promise<Admin> <: Promise<User>` holds true as result of `Admin <: User`. Saying it formal, `Promise` type is *covariant*.  

![Covariance](./images/covariance.svg)

Here's a definition of *covariance*:

> A type `T` is *covariant* if having `S <: P`, then `T<S> <: T<P>`.  

The covariance of a type is intuitive. If `Admin` is a subtype of `User`, then you can expect `Promise<Admin>` to be a subtype of `Promise<User>`.  

Covariance holds for many types in TypeScript, for example:

```ts twoslash
// @include: user
// @include: admin
// @include: is-subtype
// ---cut---

// Capitalize<T>
type T22 = IsSubtype<'Hello', string>;
//   ^?
type T23 = IsSubtype<Capitalize<'Hello'>, Capitalize<string>>;
//   ^?
```

## 3. Contravariance

Now let's consider the following generic type:

```twoslash include param
type Func<Param> = (param: Param) => void;
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: param
```

`Func<Param>` creates function types with one parameter of type `Param`.  

Having `Admin <: User`, which of the expressions is true: `Func<Admin> <: Func<User>`, or
`Func<User> <: Func<Admin>`.  

In other words, is `Func<Admin>` a subtype of `Func<User>`, or vice-versa: `Func<User>` is a subtype of `Func<Admin>`?  

Let's take a try:

```ts twoslash{5}
// @include: user
// @include: admin
// @include: is-subtype
// @include: param
// ---cut---
type T3 = IsSubtype<Func<Admin>, Func<User>>
//   ^?
type T4 = IsSubtype<Func<User>, Func<Admin>>
//   ^?
```

As the example above shows, `Func<Admin> <: Func<User>` is false.  

On the contrary, `Func<User> <: Func<Admin>` holds true &mdash; meaning that `Func<User>` is a subtype of `Func<Admin>` . The subtyping direction has flipped compared to the original types `Admin <: User`.  

Such behavior of `Func` type makes it *contravariant*. In other words, function types are contravariant in regards to their parameter types.   

![Contravariance](./images/contravariance.svg)

> A type `T` is *contravariant* if having `S <: P`, then `T<P> <: T<S>`.  

### 3.1 The idea of contravariance

The dry theory above is a bit difficult to understand, so let's find the intuitive sense behind contravariance.  

Let's define 2 functions that log the information stored in an `Admin` and `User` types of instances. `logAdmin()` logs `Admin` instances, while `logUser()` logs `User` instances information to the console.   

```twoslash include log
const logAdmin: Func<Admin> = (admin: Admin): void => {
  console.log(`Name: ${admin.userName}`);
  console.log(`Is super admin: ${admin.isSuperAdmin.toString()}`);
}

const logUser: Func<User> = (user: User): void => {
  console.log(`Name: ${user.userName}`);
}
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: param
// @include: user
// @include: admin
// ---cut---
// @include: log
```

Now let's try to assign `logUser()` function to a variable of type `Func<Admin>`, would it work?

```ts twoslash
// @include: user
// @include: admin
// @include: param
// @include: log
// ---cut---
const logger: Func<Admin> = logUser;  // OK
```

Yes, you can! Thanks to contravariance.  

The variable `logger` is of the base type `Func<Admin>`, so you can assign to it `logUser` function of type `Func<User>`.  

Now let's try the other way around: assign `logAdmin()` function to a variable of type `Func<User>`:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
// @include: user
// @include: admin
// @include: param
// @include: log
// ---cut---
const logger: Func<User> = logAdmin;
```

Nope, you can't! Again, thanks to the contravariance of functions in regards to parameter types.  

Why...?

`logger` variable is of type `Func<User>` &mdash; the subtype. And you cannot assign a variable of base type (`logAdmin` is `Func<Admin>`) to a subtype.  

As an experiment, let's disable type checking on the assignment by using type assertion to `any`. Then let's see what would happen during runtime:

```ts twoslash{9}
// @include: user
// @include: admin
// @include: param
// @include: log
// ---cut---
const logger: Func<User> = logAdmin as any;

const user = new User('user1');
logger(user);
// @error: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')"
```

[Try the demo.](https://codesandbox.io/s/musing-mountain-kgsh6?file=/src/index.ts)

A runtime error is thrown because `logger(user)`, where `logger` is `logAdmin`, cannot log the instance data because `isSuperAdmin` property doesn't exist in the class `User`.  

Contravariance prevents such errors on functions subtyping.  

## 4. Conclusion

The type `T` is covariant if having 2 types `S <: P`, then `T<S> <: T<P>` (the subtyping direction is maintained). An example of covariant type is the `Promise<T>`.  

But if `T<P> <: T<S>` (the subtyping is flipped), then `T` is contravariant. The function type is contravariant by the parameter types.  

*Challenge: What other covariant or contravariant types do you know?*
