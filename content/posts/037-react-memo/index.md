Users enjoy fast and responsive user interfaces (UI). An UI response delay of less than 100 milliseconds feels instant to the user. A delay between 100 and 300 milliseconds is already perceptible.  

To improve user interface performance, React offers a higher-order component `React.memo()`. When `React.memo()` wraps a component, React memoizes the rendered output then skips unnecessary rendering.  

This post describes the situations when `React.memo()` improves the performance, and, not less important, warns when its usage is useless.  

Plus I'll describe some useful memoization tips you should be aware of.  

## 1. React.memo()

When deciding to update DOM, React first renders your component, then compares the result with the previous render result. If the render results are different, React updates the DOM.  

Current vs previous render results comparison is fast. But you can *speed up* the process under some circumstances.  

When a component is wrapped in `React.memo()`, React renders the component and memoizes the result. Before the next render, if the new props are the same, React reuses the memoized result *skipping the next rendering*.  

Let's see the memoization in action. The functional component `Movie` is wrapped in `React.memo()`:  

```jsx
export function Movie({ title, releaseDate }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Movie title: {title}</div>
      <div>Release date: {releaseDate}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

export const MemoizedMovie = React.memo(Movie);
```

`React.memo(Movie)` returns a new memoized component `MemoizedMovie`. It will output the same content as the original `Movie` component, but with one difference. 

`MemoizedMovie` render output is memoized. The memoized content is reused as long as `title` or `releaseDate` props are the same on next renderings.  

```jsx{3-4,10-11}
// First render. React calls MemoizedMovie function.
<MemoizedMovie 
  title="Heat" 
  releaseDate="December 15, 1995" 
/>

// On next round React does not call MemoizedMovie function,
// preventing rendering
<MemoizedMovie
  title="Heat" 
  releaseDate="December 15, 1995" 
/>
```

[Open the demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-memo-demo-c9dx1), then expand the console. You will see that React renders `<MemoizedMovie>` just once, while `<Movie>` re-renders every time.  

You gain a *performance boost*: by reusing the memoized content, React skips rendering the component and doesn't perform a virtual DOM difference check.  

The same functionality for class components is implemented by [PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent).  

### 1.1 Custom equality check of props

By default `React.memo()` does a [shallow](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v16.8.6/packages/shared/shallowEqual.js) comparison of props and objects of props. 

You can use the second argument to indicate a custom equality check function:  

```javascript
React.memo(Component, [areEqual(prevProps, nextProps)]);
```


`areEqual(prevProps, nextProps)` function must return `true` if `prevProps` and `nextProps` are equal.

For example, let's manually calculate if `Movie` component props are equal:

```jsx
function moviePropsAreEqual(prevMovie, nextMovie) {
  return prevMovie.title === nextMovie.title
    && prevMovie.releaseDate === nextMovie.releaseDate;
}

const MemoizedMovie2 = React.memo(Movie, moviePropsAreEqual);
```
or

```jsx
  const MemoizedMovie2 = React.memo(Component, (prevProps, nextProps) => JSON.sringify(prevProps) == JSON.stringify(nextProps));
```

`moviePropsAreEqual()` function returns `true` if prev and next props are equal.  

## 2. When to use React.memo()

### 2.1 Component renders often with the same props

The best case of wrapping a component in `React.memo()` is when you expect the functional component to render often and usually with the same props.  

A common situation that makes a component render with the same props is being forced to render by a parent component.  

Let's reuse `Movie` component defined above. A new parent component `MovieViewsRealtime` displays the number of views of a movie, with realtime updates:  

```jsx{4}
function MovieViewsRealtime({ title, releaseDate, views }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Movie title={title} releaseDate={releaseDate} />
      Movie views: {views}
    </div>
  );
}
```
The application regularly polls the server in background (every second), updating `views` property of `MovieViewsRealtime` component.  

```jsx{3,10,17}
// Initial render
<MovieViewsRealtime 
  views={0} 
  title="Forrest Gump" 
  releaseDate="June 23, 1994" 
/>

// After 1 second, views is 10
<MovieViewsRealtime 
  views={10} 
  title="Forrest Gump" 
  releaseDate="June 23, 1994" 
/>

// After 2 seconds, views is 25
<MovieViewsRealtime 
  views={25} 
  title="Forrest Gump" 
  releaseDate="June 23, 1994" 
/>

// etc
```

Every time `views` prop is updated with a new number, `MovieViewsRealtime` renders. This triggers `Movie` rendering too, regardless of `title` and `releaseDate` being the same.  

That's the right case to apply memoization on `Movie` component.  

Improve `MovieViewsRealtime` to use the memoized component `MemoizedMovie`:

```jsx{4}
function MovieViewsRealtime({ title, releaseDate, views }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <MemoizedMovie title={title} releaseDate={releaseDate} />
      Movie views: {views}
    </div>
  )
}
```

As long as `title` and `releaseDate` props are the same, React skips rendering `MemoizedMovie`. This improves the performance of `MovieViewsRealtime` component.  

> The more often the component renders with the same props, the heavier and the more computationally expensive the output is, the more chances are that component needs to be wrapped in `React.memo()`  

Anyways, use [profiling](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#profiling-components-with-the-chrome-performance-tab) to measure the benefits of applying `React.memo()`.   

## 3. When to avoid React.memo()

If the component doesn't "re-render often with the same props", most likely you don't need `React.memo()`.  

Use the following rule of thumb: don't use memoization if you can't quantify the performance gains.  

> Performance-related changes applied incorrectly can even harm performance. Use `React.memo()` wisely.  

While possible, wrapping class-based components in `React.memo()` is undesirable. Extend `PureComponent` class or define a custom implementation of `shouldComponentUpdate()` method if you need memoization for class-based components.  

### 3.1 Useless props comparison

Imagine a component that typically renders with different props. In this case, memoization doesn't provide benefits. 

Even if you wrap such a volatile component in `React.memo()`, React does 2 jobs on every rendering:

1. Invokes the comparison function to determine whether the previous and next props are equal
2. Because props comparison almost always returns `false`, React performs the diff of previous and current render results

The invocation of the comparison function is useless because it almost always returns `false`.  

## 4. React.memo() and callback functions

The function object equals only to itself. Let's see that by comparing some functions:

```javascript{8}
function sumFactory() {
  return (a, b) => a + b;
}

const sum1 = sumFactory();
const sum2 = sumFactory();

console.log(sum1 === sum2); // => false
console.log(sum1 === sum1); // => true
console.log(sum2 === sum2); // => true
```
`sumFactory()` is a factory function. It returns functions that sum 2 numbers.  

The functions `sum1` and `sum2` are created by the factory. Both functions sum 2 numbers. However, `sum1` and `sum2` are different function objects (`sum1 === sum2` is `false`).  

Every time a parent component defines a callback for its child, it might generate new function instances. Let's study how this can break memoization, and how to fix it.   

The following component `Logout` accepts a callback prop `onLogout`:

```jsx
function Logout({ username, onLogout }) {
  return (
    <div onClick={onLogout}>
      Logout {username}
    </div>
  );
}

const MemoizedLogout = React.memo(Logout);
```

A component that accepts a callback must be handled with care when applying memoization. The parent component could provide different instances of the callback function on every render:  

```jsx{7}
function MyApp({ store, cookies }) {
  return (
    <div className="main">
      <header>
        <MemoizedLogout
          username={store.username}
          onLogout={() => cookies.clear('session')}
        />
      </header>
      {store.content}
    </div>
  );
}
```
Even if provided with the same `username` value, `MemoizedLogout` renders every time because it receives new instances of `onLogout` callback.  

Memoization is broken.  

To fix it, `onLogout` prop must receive the same callback instance. Let's apply [useCallback()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback) to preserve the callback instance between renderings:

```jsx{4-7,13}
const MemoizedLogout = React.memo(Logout);

function MyApp({ store, cookies }) {
  const onLogout = useCallback(
    () => cookies.clear('session'), 
    [cookies]
  );
  return (
    <div className="main">
      <header>
        <MemoizedLogout
          username={store.username}
          onLogout={onLogout}
        />
      </header>
      {store.content}
    </div>
  );
}
```

`useCallback(() => cookies.clear('session'), [cookies])` always returns the same function instance as long as `cookies` is the same. Memoization of `MemoizedLogout` is fixed.  

## 5. React.memo() is a performance hint

Strictly, React uses memoization as a performance hint. 

While in most situations React avoids rendering a memoized component, you shouldn't count on that to prevent rendering.  

## 6. React.memo() and hooks

Components using hooks can be freely wrapped in `React.memo()` to achieve memoization.

In case of `useState()`, React always makes sure to render the component if the state changes. Even if the component is wrapped in `React.memo()`.  

## 7. Conclusion

`React.memo()` is a great tool to memoize functional components. When applied correctly, it prevents component useless rendering when the next props equal to previous.  

Take precaution when memoizing components that use props as callbacks. Make sure to provide the same callback function instance between renderings.  

Don't forget to use [profiling](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#profiling-components-with-the-chrome-performance-tab) to measure the performance gains of memoization.
